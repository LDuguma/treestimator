# Treestimator: Tree Population Simulator üå±

Treestimator is a web-based simulation tool designed to help project leaders and environmental planners model tree populations over time. By simulating seedling survival, replacement planting (**beating up**), and thinning strategies, the tool provides a clear, year-by-year analysis of project outcomes. This enables more effective and data-driven restoration planning.

## üöÄ Key Features

![Treestimator Interface](./interface-overview.png)

*Main interface showing input parameters and simulation controls*

* **Interactive Simulation:** Enter your project details, planting schedule, and survival rates to generate a dynamic projection of your tree population.
* **Cohort-Based Modeling:** The tool tracks each year's plantings as separate cohorts, providing a detailed view of how different planting groups perform over their lifecycle.
* **Flexible Inputs:** Customize key parameters such as planting schedules, age-based survival rates, beating-up strategies, and thinning regimes.
* **Visual Data Analysis:** Understand your project's trajectory at a glance with interactive charts for total live trees and cohort survival.
* **Detailed Reporting:** Get a comprehensive year-by-year table of your simulation results and a summary of key metrics.
* **PDF Export:** Easily generate and download a professional PDF summary of your simulation for reporting and sharing.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Treestimator uses a robust simulation model based on the following principles:

* **Cohort Tracking:** Each initial planting and subsequent beating up (replacement) event is treated as a distinct group of trees (a **cohort**).
* **Age-Based Survival:** The number of surviving trees in each cohort is calculated annually based on user-defined survival rates for different age categories.
* **Beating Up Logic:** You can specify whether to replace trees that die in the first two years and define a cutoff year for when these replacement activities cease.
* **Thinning Application:** You can define multiple thinning regimes by specifying the age and percentage of trees to be removed. Thinning is applied before natural mortality for that year.
* **Mathematical Model:** The core calculation for each cohort is:

```
Survivors(end of year) = Survivors(start of year) √ó Survival Rate(age) √ó (1 - Thinning Rate if applicable)
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

Treestimator is a single-page application built with modern web technologies:

* **HTML5:** For the page structure and user interface.
* **CSS3:** For styling, responsiveness, and an engaging visual design.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For all the simulation logic, user interactions, and dynamic content generation.
* **Chart.js:** A powerful JavaScript library used for creating the interactive and visually appealing charts.
* **jsPDF & jsPDF-AutoTable:** Libraries for generating the PDF report from the simulation results.
